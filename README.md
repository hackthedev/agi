# AGI - Thoughts and Concepts

The goal of this repo is to document thoughts and concepts that result from a lot of thinking. Generally, my goal is to create a real artificial intelligence that can actually learn concepts, think and be actually intelligent, not just predict the next likely word that would fit in a sentence, like LLMs.

Since i loved the Terminator Movie AND i worked with stepper motors and built a robot, it would be the next cool thing to figure out real AI to give it control over these motors. While it sounds nerdy it would be really cool tho, right?

I will try to organize thoughts and concepts inside the `docs` folder as good as possible. Its amazing to think about how our brain may work and figure out these concepts!
