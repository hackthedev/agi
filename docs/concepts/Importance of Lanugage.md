# Importance of Language

Language itself is a very important factor when it comes to intelligence. Without any language and only signals like vision, hearing etc your system would only exist in the present time and would only act based on stimulation and act based on that.

In short: It wont think, it'll only be reactive!  You wont be able to achieve complex thoughts without language.

Basically, without language you dont really think about concepts, you dont compare things like the weather with today's weather and yesterday's weather and similar! Its also important for abstract thinking.

If you're reading this, you properly have a inner voice saying it. When reflecting or thinking about anything in general you probably use language for that too. Its a very important fundamental key element when it comes to intelligence.
